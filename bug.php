This code snippet demonstrates a common error in PHP related to undefined array keys.  When accessing array elements using bracket notation, if the key doesn't exist, PHP will issue a warning and return NULL.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and errors, especially within larger applications. This example shows an attempt to access the 'city' key, which might not always be present in the `$userData` array.

```php
<?php
$userData = array(
    'name' => 'John Doe',
    'country' => 'USA'
);

$city = $userData['city']; // Potential error: Notice: Undefined index: city

echo "City: " . $city; // Outputs 'City: '
?>
```
